HoloKitSDK is to build AR/MR apps for HoloKit. Currently, we provide the SDK as Unity package.

For Google Tango, please checkout "tango" branch.
For Apple iOS (ARKit), please checkout "ios" branch. 
For Android (ARCore), please checkout "android" branch. 

For detailed manual, please see [HoloKitSDK Reference Manual](docs/MANUAL.md).

7. Click "Run" to build and launch the example on your device. 
8. If you get build failure regarding code signing, try to understand [Launching Your App on Devices](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/LaunchingYourApponDevices/LaunchingYourApponDevices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH27-SW4). For other problems see Troubleshooting below.
9. After the app runs, you should see a cube and a sphere floating in the air somewhere. You may gaze at the sphere and it'll turn to red.

## Create your own experience

2. Drag and drop everything in "HoloKitSDK/StarterPrefabs" to the scene, and delete the default "Main Camera" and "Directional Light".

3. Put anything you like under "HoloKitPlacementRoot", and your model should have a comparable size as "DebugCube". Then feel free to turn off or delete "DebugCube".
